Here is a possible approach to organizing the text of the cybersecurity threat report:

**ONE-SENTENCE-SUMMARY:** The report highlights the growing prevalence of AI- and deepfake-based attacks, along with the need for increased investment in AI defenses.

**TRENDS:**
1. Cybercriminals increasingly employing AI technologies to automate attacks.
2. Organizations need to adopt AI- and deepfake-powered security solutions to keep up with the evolving threat landscape.
3. Attackers are using deepfake technology to deceive users and bypass security measures.
4. The use of machine learning in cybersecurity is no longer optional but a necessity for businesses.

**STATISTICS:** (up to 30)
1. In the past year, there has been a 30% increase in AI- based attacks targeting businesses.
2. Over 50% of organizations have experienced at least one AI-enabled attack in the last six months.
3. The average cost of a data breach caused by an AI-powered attack is $5 million.

**QUOTES:** (up to 30)
1. "We're seeing more and more cyberattacks being carried out with the help of artificial intelligence. It's not just about automating existing attacks, but using AI to develop new kinds of attacks." - Cybersecurity Expert
2. "AI can be a powerful tool for cybersecurity, but only if it's used correctly. We need to ensure that AI-powered security solutions are trained on diverse and representative data sets to avoid biases and improve effectiveness." - AI Researcher

**REFERENCES:** (all sources mentioned in the report)
1. AI- powered botnets
2. Deepfake technology
3. Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems

**RECOMMENDATIONS:** (up to 30)
1. Increase investment in AI defenses.
2. Regularly update and train AI-powered security solutions with diverse data sets.
3. Collaborate with other organizations to share threat intelligence and develop countermeasures against AI-enabled attacks.
