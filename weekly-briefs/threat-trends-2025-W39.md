- **Cloud Security**: → Stable but high-risk environment
- **Remote Work Targeting**: ↑ Rising through proxy infrastructure abuse

### Prediction Matrix
| Threat Category | 2-Week Outlook | 1-Month Outlook | Confidence |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Ransomware | Continued focus on social engineering | Geographic expansion | High |
| Supply Chain | Additional package managers targeted | New worm variants | High |
| Proxy Infrastructure | Increased residential proxy abuse | Regulatory attention | Medium |
| Cryptocurrency Fraud | New gambling site variants | Platform diversification | Medium |

### Defensive Recommendations
#### Immediate Priorities
- Implement package signing and verification
- Enhanced monitoring of developer credential usage
- Review and restrict proxy service usage

#### Strategic Adjustments
- Develop supply chain integrity monitoring capabilities
- Implement phishing-resistant authentication
- Enhanced social engineering awareness training
