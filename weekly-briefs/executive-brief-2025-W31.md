# Weekly Cybersecurity Intelligence Brief
## Week of August 1-7, 2025

### Executive Summary

During the past week, ransomware attacks have remained a significant threat, with multiple incidents involving exploiting vulnerabilities and advanced persistent threats targeting organizations. Data breaches also increased, impacting industries globally. Financial sectors faced technical issues, causing disruptions in online banking services. WhatsApp introduced anti-scam features to improve user security.

### Critical Threat Developments

#### Ransomware Attack: Akira
- **Description**: The Akira ransomware gang is exploiting an Intel CPU driver vulnerability to disable Microsoft Defender on victim machines.
- **Business Impact**: This attack can lead to data loss or theft, disrupting normal business operations.
- **Affected Industries**: All industries using Intel-based devices and Microsoft Defender as their antivirus software.
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Recommended Actions**: Update all affected systems with the latest security patches. Consider implementing additional layers of protection like endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.

#### Advanced Persistent Threats - 'Ghost Calls'
- **Description**: An advanced persistent threat actor is leveraging a new technique called "Ghost Calls" to evade network detection.
- **Business Impact**: This tactic can enable stealthy initial access to victim systems, leading to data theft or other malicious activities.
- **Affected Industries**: All industries with network-connected devices and applications using TURN servers for conferencing apps.
- **Risk Level**: Critical
- **Recommended Actions**: Monitor traffic for unusual patterns consistent with Ghost Calls. Regularly review logs for suspicious activity in your network.

#### Data Breach - Salesforce CRM Theft
- **Description**: Threat actors are targeting organizations that use Salesforce Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, stealing sensitive data and demanding ransoms.
- **Business Impact**: Confidential customer information, intellectual property, or financial records could be at risk.
- **Affected Industries**: All industries using Salesforce CRM solutions.
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Recommended Actions**: Ensure all Salesforce patches and updates are current. Implement additional security measures such as data encryption at rest and in transit.

### Industry Risk Assessment

| Sector | Risk Level | Primary Concerns | Recommended Focus |
|--------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Financial Services | High | Security breaches leading to financial losses or reputational damage | Strengthen access controls, regular security audits, and employee training on phishing awareness |
| Healthcare | High | Protected Health Information (PHI) data breaches impacting patient care | Regularly review logs for PHI exposure risk, conduct regular security training, and implement strong encryption measures |
| Manufacturing | Medium-High | Operational disruptions due to ransomware or supply chain attacks | Implement robust endpoint protection, regularly backup critical systems and data, and enforce strict security policies during third-party vendor interactions |

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (0-7 days)
1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment of current security measures against identified threats.
2. Enhance incident response plans based on the identified risks.

#### Short-term Priorities (1-4 weeks)
1. Train employees on identifying phishing attempts and maintaining strong password hygiene.
2. Regularly update software, including operating systems, applications, and antivirus solutions.

### Threat Landscape Outlook

In the upcoming week, threat actors may continue to focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in widely used software or targeting organizations that use Salesforce CRM software. We recommend monitoring these trends closely and remaining vigilant against potential threats.
