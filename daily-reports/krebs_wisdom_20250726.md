In June 2021, Microsoft released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws was already under active attack, and the software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug patched that month were public. The sole zero-day flaw this month was CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of WebDAV - an HTTP extension that lets users remotely manage files and directories on a server. Another vulnerability, CVE-2025-33073, had an "elevation of privilege" vulnerability in the SMB client, which was likely to be exploited given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public. Beyond these highlights, 10 vulnerabilities fixed that month were rated "critical" by Microsoft, including eight remote code execution flaws.
