This RSS feed contains the latest articles from Krebs on Security, a blog that covers cybersecurity news and analysis.

The first article in this feed is about Microsoft releasing security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, and an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the SMB client is likely to be exploited due to proof-of-concept code being publicly available.

The second article mentions Adobe releasing updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, while Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome have also released security updates that require a restart of the browser to take effect.
