In June 2021, Microsoft released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, and software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug patched this month are now public. The sole zero-day flaw this month is CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of WebDAV - an HTTP extension that lets users remotely manage files and directories on a server. While WebDAV isn't enabled by default in Windows, its presence in legacy or specialized systems still makes it a relevant target. Microsoft warns that an "elevation of privilege" vulnerability in the Windows Server Message Block (SMB) client (CVE-2025-33073) is likely to be exploited, given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public. Adobe also released updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, most of them in an update for Experience Manager.
