In June 2021, Microsoft released security updates to address at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws was already under active attack, with software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug that had been patched being made public. The sole zero-day flaw this month was CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows implementation of WebDAV - an HTTP extension allowing users to remotely manage files and directories on a server. Proof-of-concept code for another vulnerability, CVE-2025-33073 (an "elevation of privilege" vulnerability in the SMB client), was also made public. Adobe released updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, mostly in an update for Experience Manager. Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome both released security updates that required a restart of the browser to take effect; the latest Chrome update fixed two zero-day exploits in the browser (CVE-2025-5419 and CVE-2025-4664).
