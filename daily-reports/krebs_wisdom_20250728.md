In this month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, with software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug patched this month now public. The sole zero-day flaw this month is CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of WebDAV. While WebDAV isn't enabled by default in Windows, its presence in legacy or specialized systems still makes it a relevant target. Microsoft warns that an "elevation of privilege" vulnerability in the SMB client (CVE-2025-33073) is likely to be exploited given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public. Beyond these vulnerabilities fixed this month, 10 were rated "critical" by Microsoft, including eight remote code execution flaws.
