In June 2025, Microsoft released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, and an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the SMB client (CVE-2025-33073) is likely to be exploited. Proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public, leading to potential SYSTEM-level control over a vulnerable PC. The 10 vulnerabilities rated "critical" by Microsoft included eight remote code execution flaws. Adobe released updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, most of them in an update for Experience Manager. Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome both recently released security updates that required a restart of the browser to take effect.
