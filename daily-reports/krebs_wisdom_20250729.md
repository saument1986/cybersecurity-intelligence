In this article, the author discusses Microsoft's release of security updates to address at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, with software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug now publicly available. The sole zero-day flaw this month is CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of WebDAVâ€”an HTTP extension that lets users remotely manage files and directories on a server. While WebDAV isn't enabled by default in Windows, its presence in legacy or specialized systems still makes it a relevant target. Additionally, an "elevation of privilege" vulnerability in the Windows Server Message Block (SMB) client (CVE-2025-33073) is likely to be exploited, given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public.

In other news, Adobe has released updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, most of them in an update for Experience Manager. Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome both recently released security updates that require a restart of the browser to take effect. The latest Chrome update fixes two zero-day exploits in the browser (CVE-2025-5419 and CVE-2025-4664).
