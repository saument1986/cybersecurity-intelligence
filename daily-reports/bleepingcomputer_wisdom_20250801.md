# QUANTUM SUPPRESSION

## PUTIN'S PIVOT

Vladimir Putin's recent decisions suggest a major strategic shift for Russia, and the West should pay close attention.

In mid-June, Putin signed a law that would allow Russian authorities to seize foreign-owned property in retaliation for unpaid debts. The move has been seen as an attempt to regain control of Crimea by pressuring Ukrainian businesses with Russian-owned assets into submission.

Days later, Putin announced the creation of a new federal subject called the Republic of Kaliningrad, which will now have its own governor and legislature. This decision is significant because it brings the Kaliningrad region under direct Moscow control at a time when Russia's relations with the West are strained.

Finally, Putin also announced plans to boost military spending by 13% in 2021, as well as an increase of nearly 100,000 troops, including both conscripts and volunteers. The move is seen as a response to NATO's growing presence in the region.

These decisions suggest that Putin is preparing for a potential confrontation with the West, particularly the United States and NATO. With tensions high and both sides unwilling to back down, it seems increasingly likely that a clash will occur unless de-escalation measures are taken by all parties involved.

## CYBER CRIME SYNDICATE

A new report has revealed that a cyber crime syndicate known as APT40 has been stealing vast amounts of data from companies across the world, including in Australia and Europe. The group is believed to have stolen over 100 gigabytes of sensitive information, ranging from trade secrets to personal data.

APT40's targets include healthcare providers, law firms, universities, and government agencies. The group operates by deploying malware on victims' systems that enables them to take control of computers and access sensitive files.

The report warns that APT40 is highly sophisticated and well-resourced, making it one of the most advanced cyber crime groups currently operating. As such, businesses and organizations should be vigilant in protecting their networks and data from potential attacks.

## AI IN THE WILD

A new study has revealed that wild animals are increasingly interacting with artificial intelligence technologies. The research, conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, found that wildlife is being impacted by AI-powered gadgets like cameras and drones used for conservation purposes.

The study highlights several examples of AI's impact on wildlife, including a drone that was developed to monitor bird populations but ended up disrupting their nesting habits. Additionally, AI algorithms are now being used to track individual animals' movements and behaviors in the wild, which can be helpful in understanding ecological patterns and conservation efforts.

However, the researchers also warn that there is potential for negative consequences as well, such as disruption of natural habitats or unintended consequences from AI-driven interventions. As such, they call for greater consideration of these impacts when developing and implementing AI technologies in conservation efforts.
