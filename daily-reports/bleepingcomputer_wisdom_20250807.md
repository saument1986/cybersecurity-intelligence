# SUMMARY

Akira ransomware is abusing a legitimate Intel CPU tuning driver to turn off Microsoft Defender in attacks from security tools and EDRs running on target machines.

A new post-exploitation command-and-control (C2) evasion method called 'Ghost Calls' abuses TURN servers used by conferencing apps like Zoom for communication.

Google is the latest company to suffer a data breach in an ongoing wave of Salesforce CRM data theft attacks conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group.
