A recent report from the security firm, KrebsOnSecurity, reveals more about the workings of VexTrio, a notorious ad tech fraud operation that's been siphoning off billions of dollars in revenue for several years. The report explains how VexTrio and a network of associated "typosquatting" domains operate to deliver ads for fake websites to unsuspecting users. Typosquatting is a form of cybersquatting, where domain names are registered to imitate legitimate sites with slight typographical errors.

VexTrio's operation takes advantage of hacked WordPress websites, exploiting the fact that many site owners never update their software or plugins, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Hackers then insert malicious code into the site that forces it to redirect visitors to VexTrio-controlled domains where ads are served and revenue is generated through ad fraud.

One of the ways VexTrio generates ad revenue involves using fake CAPTCHA tests to trick users into granting permission for sites to send them notifications, which can contain malicious links. To combat this, users should be cautious when approving site notifications, as they may lead to malware or scams.

To protect against VexTrio and similar attacks, users are advised to avoid clicking on unfamiliar ads and to be careful when entering personal details into websites, especially if they suspect the site has been hacked. Additionally, keeping software up-to-date and using security products such as ad blockers can help mitigate the risk of falling victim to these types of scams.
