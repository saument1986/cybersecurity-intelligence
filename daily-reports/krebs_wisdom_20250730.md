In this security update, Microsoft has released patches to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, with software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug now publicly available. The sole zero-day flaw this month is CVE-2025-33053, a remote code execution vulnerabilityÂ in the Windows implementation of WebDAV that isn't enabled by default in Windows but still has relevance in legacy or specialised systems. Additionally, an "elevation of privilege" vulnerability in the SMB client (CVE-2025-33073) is likely to be exploited given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is publicly available. Beyond these vulnerabilities, 10 of the flaws fixed this month were rated "critical" by Microsoft, including eight remote code execution flaws.
