A recent report reveals a Russian organized cyber crime group operating a sophisticated and lucrative adtech fraud scheme, which has managed to steal millions of dollars in revenue from unwitting website owners. This group has been able to maintain its control over the adtech fraud ecosystem by using fake CAPTCHAs that drive user acceptance of push notifications. The scheme involves hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in popular platforms such as Wordpress to inject malicious code into compromised websites, leading them to redirect visitors to a tangled web of ads and scams. To prevent this type of attack, it is advised to be very sparing with allowing site notifications, which can be prevented by modifying the settings on major browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple's Safari.
