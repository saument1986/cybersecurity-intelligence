A report has detailed how a Russian-linked adtech empire, VexTrio - which operates an adtech Cabal - is redirecting thousands of hacked website visitors to fake CAPTCHA schemes. The scheme exploits users' tolerance for the usual Google reCAPTCHA or similar security measures by using them as cover for other malicious activity. Users are tricked into thinking they're simply dealing with a standard CAPTCHA request when they're actually providing data that's used in scams and malware distribution campaigns. VexTrio is also linked to four other "push monetisation" programs, all of which pay affiliates to drive sign-ups for various schemes, mostly online dating services.
