In this month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and software. One of the flaws is already under active attack, and an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the SMB client is likely to be exploited due to proof-of-concept code being publicly available. Adobe has also released updates for Acrobat Reader and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities. Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome both recently released security updates that require a restart of the browser to take effect, with the latest Chrome update fixing two zero-day exploits in the browser.
