This article provides an in-depth look at the inner workings of a vast and insidious adtech empire that has been operating for years, feeding off compromised websites worldwide. The operation, which primarily targets unsuspecting users through deceptive pop-ups and notifications, appears to be run by Russian organized crime syndicates. 

The authors detail how this adtech empire operates by exploiting WordPress sites that have been hacked to display malicious notification popups aimed at getting users to allow advertising notifications. These ads pay the site owners for each click and redirect victims to a tangled web of other adtech companies, many with links to Russia.

To protect yourself against these types of attacks, it's recommended to be selective when allowing notifications on websites and use browser settings to block them altogether where possible.
