2. Scattered Spider threat actor replicates techniques used by successful actors like Lapsus$.
3. The average time spent on triage in forensic investigations is critical for efficient data analysis.

# QUOTES:
1. "Social engineering does not require a lot of technical tools; creativity is key." - SANS Internet Storm Center
2. "Triage allows investigators to quickly identify, prioritize, and isolate the most relevant evidence from large volumes of data." - SANS Internet Storm Center

# REFERENCES:
1. Scattered Spider threat actor.
2. Lapsus$ threat actor.
3. Tea App breach.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Regularly update Apple devices with security patches to mitigate vulnerability risks.
