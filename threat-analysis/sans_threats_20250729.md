# ONE-SENTENCE-SUMMARY:
Last week, newly exploited SharePoint vulnerabilities took a lot of our attention. It is fair to assume that last Monday (July 21st), all exposed vulnerable SharePoint installs were exploited.

# TRENDS:

1. New exploit attempts in circulation for CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771
2. Scans by researchers to identify vulnerable systems or common artifacts of compromise.
3. Honeypots receiving a higher volume of hits without having to emulate SharePoint better.
4. WinRAR 7.10 does not fully propagate all Mark-of-The-Web data when extracting files from archives.
