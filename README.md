# Cybersecurity Intelligence System

An automated threat intelligence pipeline using AI-powered analysis patterns to process cybersecurity feeds and extract actionable insights.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system continuously monitors cybersecurity news sources and threat feeds, applying structured AI analysis patterns to extract key insights, trends, and actionable intelligence. Built as part of my transition into cybersecurity, demonstrating practical application of threat intelligence methodologies.

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **AI Analysis**: Fabric (Daniel Miessler's AI pattern framework)
- **Language Model**: Dolphin Llama 3 (8B parameters, CPU inference)
- **Automation**: Cron jobs + Bash scripts
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers on Ubuntu Server
- **Sources**: Curated RSS feeds from industry leaders

## 📊 Intelligence Sources

- **Krebs on Security** - Investigative cybercrime reporting
- **SANS Internet Storm Center** - Daily threat advisories
- **Dark Reading** - Enterprise security trends
- **Microsoft Security Blog** - Real-world threat intelligence
- **US-CERT Alerts** - Government security advisories

## 🧠 Analysis Patterns

- **extract_wisdom** - Key insights and takeaways
- **analyze_threats** - Security risk assessment
- **find_patterns** - Trend identification across sources
- **create_questions** - Follow-up research topics
